#+title: Dotfiles

* Overview

This repository contains configurations for my editor, (doom) ~emacs~, my shell, ~zsh~, and for various other useful tools.

* Install

The ~install.sh~ script will install all required libraries and packages which are part of my configuration.

The ~link.sh~ script will remove all conflicting pre-existing dotfiles repository and replace them with symlinks to the dotfiles in this repository.

Clone this repository and ~cd~ to the root folder and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
chmod +x .setup/* && .setup/install.sh && .setup/link.sh
#+END_SRC

I also recommend changing your shell to ~zsh~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
#+END_SRC
